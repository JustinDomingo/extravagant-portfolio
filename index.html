    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="p">Hello there! I am Justin Domingo and I am a self-taught web developer. I've always had somewhat of an interest in coding since my dad is a software developer, but what really got me hooked was seeing web pages and games come to life. By the time I discovered it's limitless capabilities, I was completely immersed in the world of code. I began teaching myself through several hours of online learning, researching, and project-making. I also took and completed an online course about full-stack JavaScript programming, which included the use of Node, Express, mongoDB, and Socket.io. Since then, I've graduated into more advanced concepts like REST API, asynchronous code, etc. Along with this, I've also started learning about the basics of React and it's hooks. Now I am looking for an opportunity to demonstrate my skills and knowledge of programming.</p>
